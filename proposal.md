## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a messaging platform that is formatted as a blank document that allows for 
real-time collaboration between users.

## Background
Real-time collaboration has been implemented as a feature in word processing software, such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and 
Pages. These applications provide a more professional and formal environment for document writing. Our project aims to provide
a similar environment geared towards social interaction.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Requirements
* The application shall require users to have accounts.
  * Email, Display Name, Password
  * Multi-Factor Authentication
  * Google/Facebook authentication
* The application shall allow user input to be displayed to other authorized users in real-time.
* Users have "conversations" with each other where the conversation is updated in real-time with other's input
* Notifications will be when a user is typing/has typed within the conversation
* When a user re-enters a conversation, they'll be shown the changes made to the conversation since the last time they were 
there
* A mini-map can be displayed in the corner of the screen that shows an overview of the conversation and where other users are 
in it 
* Lock content
  * Essentially pinning an excerpt so that it can't be edited
  * Possibly lock position and content
* Formatting will be stored as XML
* Input images and animated gifs
* Highlight excerpt and get history of it
  * Which user typed what
* Search through conversations and users
